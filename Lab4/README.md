# Turtle Letter Drawing

This Python script allows you to draw letters using the Turtle module. It provides functions for drawing individual letters of the alphabet, as well as punctuation marks.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Run the script.
2. Choose one of the following options:
   - Option 1: Draw a text message.
   - Option 2: Define a new character.
3. If you choose Option 1, you can input a word, and the script will draw it using the predefined letter functions. If the letter is not predefined, you will need to define it using Option 2.
4. If you choose Option 2, you can define a new character by drawing it manually using keyboard controls. Once you finish drawing the character, press 'Return' to save it.
5. The script will save the defined characters in a file named `caractere.txt`.

## Customization

You can customize the script by adding new drawing functions for additional letters or characters. Each drawing function should take a Turtle object as an argument and draw the corresponding letter or character.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module
