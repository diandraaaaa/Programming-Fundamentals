# README: Programming Fundamentals Lab Homework

## Introduction
Welcome to the README for the Programming Fundamentals Lab Homework. This document provides an overview of the lab assignments completed during the first semester, detailing the topics covered and the skills acquired. These lab assignments served as a practical supplement to the theoretical knowledge gained in the programming fundamentals course.

## Course Overview
The Programming Fundamentals course aimed to introduce fundamental programming concepts using Python. Throughout the semester, students were exposed to basic programming constructs, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and the concept of layered architecture.

## Lab Homework Overview
The lab homework assignments were designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lectures through hands-on coding exercises. Each assignment focused on a specific aspect of Python programming, OOP, or layered architecture. By completing these assignments, I gained practical experience and a deeper understanding of programming fundamentals.

## Topics Covered
1. **Python Basics:** The initial lab assignments covered the basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, operators, and control structures such as loops and conditional statements.
2. **Functions and Modules:** Subsequent assignments delved into the concept of functions, parameter passing, and the creation and usage of modules in Python programs.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A significant portion of the lab homeworks was dedicated to learning OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Through practical exercises, I gained proficiency in creating classes, defining methods, and implementing inheritance hierarchies.
4. **Layered Architecture:** Towards the latter part of the semester, the focus shifted towards understanding layered architecture in software development. Lab assignments in this area involved designing and implementing programs following a layered architectural pattern, emphasizing separation of concerns and modularity.

## Skills Acquired
1. **Python Programming:** Through completing the lab homeworks, I developed a solid foundation in Python programming, becoming proficient in writing clean, efficient, and readable code.
2. **Basic OOP Concepts:** The lab assignments provided practical experience in applying OOP principles to solve programming problems, which enhanced my ability to design and implement object-oriented solutions.
3. **Layered Architecture Design:** By working on assignments related to layered architecture, I learned how to structure software systems in a modular and scalable manner, which is crucial for developing maintainable and extensible applications.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the lab homeworks for the Programming Fundamentals course were instrumental in reinforcing theoretical concepts and building practical programming skills. Through these assignments, I gained proficiency in Python programming, basic OOP principles, and layered architecture design, laying a strong foundation for further study and professional development in the field of software engineering.
